## About
This repository is based on a React course from Udacity and is forked from a template/starter project that only contained static content. The goal of this project was to convert the static content from the starter project into a dynamic application.

The this Node application now allows users to search for books and add them to various shelves in their personal library.

In addition to fulfilling the basic requirements, I added a CSS transition when switching between the library and search pages. I also added special messaging for when shelves or search results are empty, as well as a button to clear the search input when there are no results.

## Getting started

To run the project do the following:

1. install all project dependencies with `npm install`
2. start the development server with `npm start`

OR

1. install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
2. start the development server with `yarn start`

## Special Thanks :pray:

Thank you Udacity, Tyler McGinnis, and Eric Elliot for the course, tutorials, and informative articles, respectively.
